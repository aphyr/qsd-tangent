Changes in version 1.3.5:

1. Removed obsolete compiler options from Complex.cc.

2. Fixed a minor bug in Complex.cc.

3. Fixed a minor bug in State.cc.

4. Fixed a minor bug in ACG.cc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 1.3.4:

1.) Fixed minor bug in Makefile.

2.) Improved instructions in README.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions in version 1.3.3:

1.) New example program `onespin.cc'; improved comments in the existing
example programs.

2.) The directory `doc' contains, in LaTeX as well as postscript
format, a detailed description of the code, which has been published
in Comp. Phys. Comm. 102 (1997) 210-228.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major differences between versions 1.2 and 1.3:

1.) The test program `testprog.cc' now uses a simple
platform-independent random-number generator. The results produced by
`testprog.cc' should now be the same for all operating systems and C++
dialects.

2.) The directory `example_output' contains the output of all example
programs.  The output was obtained using Gnu g++ Version 2.7.2 on a
DEC Alpha under Digital UNIX. Different compilers or operating systems
may produce different results except for `testprog.cc' (see above).

3.) We added the example program `template.cc'.

4.) The method `Trajectory::plotExp' now allows one to specify a file
into which the final state is saved.

5.) The method `Trajectory::sumExp' now computes the imaginary as well
as the real parts of operator expectation values.

6.) `Makefile' is now be compatible with standard (nonGnu) versions of
`make'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major differences between versions 1.1 and 1.2:

1.) The quantum jump and orthogonal jump unravelings have been added
via the "stepper" classes `AdaptiveJump' and `AdaptiveOrthoJump'.
The example program `moving.cc' illustrates how to use `AdaptiveJump'.

2.) A bug involving a wrong nested loop in `sumExp' has been fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of major differences between versions 1.0 and 1.1:

1.) The third argument of the function `plotExp' is now a list of file
names, not a list of file pointers as before. The old version of
`plotExp' has been renamed to `plotExp_obsolete'. The example programs 
`simple.cc', `spins.cc', and `moving.cc' show how to use `plotExp'.

2.) A new function named `sumExp' permits to compute the mean of
expectation values over many trajectories. The example program
`sums.cc' illustrates how to use 'sumExp'.

3.) The program now compiles and runs under VMS using DEC C++.

4.) A quantum jump stepper has been added, but detailed comments will
not be available before version 1.2.

5.) The files `src/AtomOp.cc' and `include/AtomOp.h' define the new
primary operator class `TransitionOperator'.

6.) A test program has been added to enable users to check correct
installation. See the file `TEST' for details.
