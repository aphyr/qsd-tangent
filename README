To test that the program has been installed correctly, follow the
instructions in the file `TEST'.

------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and run any of the example programs in a UNIX environment,
make sure the directory containing this `README' file is the current
directory.  To compile, e.g., `onespin.cc', type `make onespin'. To
run it, type `./onespin'.

------------------------------------------------------------------

A good way to start exploring the library is to modify one of the 
example programs. E.g., type

`cp onespin.cc myprog.cc'

Then make any desired changes in the file `myprog.cc' and type

`make myprog'

To run `myprog', type `./myprog'.

------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a program name different from  `myprog', add 
the following lines to `Makefile':

myprog: myprog.cc $(OBJ)
	$(LINK) -o myprog myprog.cc $(OBJ) $(LOADLIBES)

where all four (!) occurrences of `myprog' must be changed to the
desired name.  Note that these two lines must be followed as well as
preceded by blank lines, and that the second line starts with a `TAB'.

------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a different directory for your program files, 
copy `Makefile' and `myprog.cc' to the directory of your choice. 
Make sure the directory of your choice is the current directory.
Change the third line in `Makefile' to 

QSD_DIR = $(HOME)/QSD-1.3.5

if the directory `QSD-1.3.5' is located in your home
directory. Otherwise insert the appropriate path. 
Then type `make myprog' to compile and `./myprog' to run the program.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory `doc' contains, in LaTeX as well as postscript
format, a detailed description of the code, which has been published
in Comp. Phys. Comm. 102 (1997) 210-228.
