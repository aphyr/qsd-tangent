onespin.cc:  One spin, one or more trajectories, very detailed comments.

template.cc: Uses many features, may serve as a template.

testprog.cc: Test program; identical to template.cc except that it uses a
             simple portable random-number generator.

simple.cc:   Simple harmonic oscillator, one trajectory.

moving.cc:   Simple harmonic oscillator, using the moving basis, one 
             trajectory.
             Different unravelings can be chosen by uncommenting or
             commenting out the appropriate lines.

spins.cc:    Two interacting spins, time-dependent Hamiltonian, one 
             trajectory.

sums.cc:     Simple harmonic oscillator, sum over trajectories.
